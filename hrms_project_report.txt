# HRMS Project Submission Report

## 1. Project Overview & Module Purpose
This Human Resource Management System (HRMS) automates employee attendance using secure Face Recognition and Geolocation verification.

### **Modules & Technical Stack Breakdown**

This section details the software modules and libraries used to build the HRMS system and their specific purposes.

#### **A. Backend Modules (API & Logic)**
The backend is built using **Python 3.10+** and handles all business logic, security, and database communication.

| Module / Library | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FastAPI** | High-performance web framework used to create the API endpoints (Routes) for the application. |
| **Uvicorn** | The ASGI server implementation that runs the FastAPI application independently. |
| **Motor** | An asynchronous Python driver for MongoDB, allowing non-blocking database operations. |
| **Beanie** | An ODM (Object Document Mapper) that structures MongoDB data into Python classes (Models) like `Employee` and `Attendance`. |
| **Pydantic** | Used for data validation and settings management (ensures API receives correct data formats). |
| **Passlib & PyJWT** | Handles password hashing (security) and JWT Token generation for secure user authentication (Login). |
| **Python-Multipart** | Process file uploads to receive image data from the frontend. |
| **Boto3** | The AWS SDK for Python, used to securely upload and retrieve images from the **Amazon S3** bucket. |

**Key Backend Files:**
*   `main.py`: The entry point that initializes the API and Database connection.
*   `database.py`: Configuration for connecting to MongoDB Atlas.
*   `face_recognition_service.py`: Contains the logic to compare incoming face images with stored reference photos.
*   `routers/`: Separate module folders for `admin`, `auth`, and `employee` API routes.

#### **B. Frontend Modules (User Interface)**
The frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using **Next.js (React)**.

| Module / Library | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Next.js** | The React framework used for server-side rendering, routing, and optimizing the web application. |
| **React DOM** | Manages the dynamic updating of the web page content without reloading. |
| **Tailwind CSS** | A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the entire application (Responsive Design). |
| **Face-api.js** | A JavaScript API for face detection and recognition in the browser (used for Liveness checks). |
| **Lucide-React** | Provides the modern icons (Camera, User, Checkmark) used throughout the UI. |
| **Axios / Fetch** | Used to send HTTP requests (Login, Check-in) from the browser to the Backyard API. |

**Key Frontend Directories:**
*   `app/`: Contains the page routing logic (e.g., `/employee/attendance`, `/admin/dashboard`).
*   `components/`: Reusable UI blocks like `FaceCheck.tsx` (Camera logic) and `Navbar.tsx`.
*   `hooks/`: Custom logic functions like `useFaceMatching.ts` to handle complex face verification workflows.

## 2. How to Run on Localhost
Follow these steps to run the complete application on a local machine.

### **Prerequisites**
1.  **Node.js** installed.
2.  **Python 3.10+** installed.
3.  **No Local Database Required:** The app connects automatically to the MongoDB Atlas Cloud.

### **Step 1: Start the Backend**
1.  Open your terminal in the `backend/` folder.
2.  Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Start the API server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
    ```
    *You will see: `Application startup complete.`*

### **Step 2: Start the Frontend**
1.  Open a **new** terminal in the `frontend/` folder.
2.  Install the JavaScript libraries:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the User Interface:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    *The App will open at: `http://localhost:3000`*

## 3. Required AWS Configurations (Storage Only)
Although the application runs on Localhost, it utilizes **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)** to securely store employee face images in the cloud. This ensures images are accessible from anywhere.

### **Amazon S3 Setup Details**
To enable image storage, the following AWS configurations are active in the application:

*   **Service Used:** Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service).
*   **Region:** `ap-south-1` (Mumbai).
*   **Bucket Name:** `hrms-employee-faces`
    *   *Purpose:* Stores the reference photos uploaded by Admins and captured during attendance.
*   **Permissions (IAM):**
    *   The application uses a secure `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY` to talk to this bucket.
    *   **CORS Configuration:** The bucket is configured to allow `GET` and `PUT` requests from `localhost:3000` to allow direct image uploading.

*(Note: No other AWS services like EC2 or Docker are required for this Localhost submission.)*
